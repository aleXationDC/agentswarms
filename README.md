**AgentSwarms** is a self-hosted, source-available platform for running AI
agents against your own data.

The agent side is what you'd expect: agent chat, a visual canvas for multi-agent
swarms, knowledge bases with RAG (hybrid search, parent-child and Q&A indexing),
MCP in both directions, batch evaluations, and execution traces with per-call
costs. What's less usual is what sits underneath. A semantic layer holds your
metric definitions, so an agent asked about revenue uses the same definition
your finance team does instead of guessing at a column. The data catalog tracks
lineage, so an answer can be traced back to the table it came from. Model rules,
spend budgets and a hash-chained audit trail apply per user and per group, and
they run before the call rather than reporting on it afterwards. Dashboards,
alerts and scheduled reports read those same definitions.

Warehouses connect directly — Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, Trino,
ClickHouse, Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres and MySQL among them — alongside file
uploads and SaaS sources like Stripe, Shopify and HubSpot.

Running it takes one Supabase project and one Docker command. Your data stays in
that Supabase project, and models run on your own provider keys: OpenRouter,
OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Azure, OCI, Qwen, Grok, Groq, Ollama, vLLM.
Set one instance-wide OpenRouter key and people can start without configuring a
provider at all.

## A look at it

**Swarm canvas** — design a multi-agent workflow as a graph and run it end to
end. Each node is a step (agent, router, condition, loop, approval, tool call);
the inspector sets its provider, model, prompt, tools and knowledge. The same
graph runs from the canvas, from the API and on a schedule — the canvas edits a
draft, and API keys and schedules keep serving the last **published** snapshot
until you promote it.

**AI Analyst** — a dedicated conversational-analysis surface: create
analysts (a reasoning model pinned to your data, nothing else to configure)
that plan each question into steps, write and run the SQL, check their own
work, and write up findings where every number cites its step. Every step
gets its own chart, can be pinned to a dashboard or edited and re-run, and
the whole trace exports as a branded PDF. Contribution analysis, trends,
outliers and projections are computed in code rather than narrated — and it
asks a clarifying question instead of guessing when one is genuinely needed.

**BI Workspace** — multi-page dashboards over your connected tables and
warehouses, with KPIs, cross-filtering, scheduled refresh, PDF export and
publish-and-share links.

**Agent Chat, with Visual BI** — ask a question in plain language and get a
chart computed from your own data beside the answer. The SQL that produced it is
shown as the source, so the number is checkable rather than asserted.

**Agent Chat, generating documents** — turn the conversation and your data into
a real, editable PowerPoint, Word document or Excel workbook. The Excel can pull
every row with live formulas rather than a pasted snapshot.

**Developer workspace** — Python notebooks on sandboxed server kernels with real
`langchain`, `langgraph` and `llama_index` installed. Model and knowledge-base
calls are brokered by the platform, so no provider key ever exists inside the
sandbox. Notebooks can call your deployed agents, and can themselves be
published as callable APIs.

| 🔑 **Secrets Manager**           | Store credentials once (encrypted, write-only) and reference them anywhere as `{{secret:NAME}}` — warehouse connections, provider keys. Superadmins share secrets with users/groups via IAM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 🗂️ **Data Catalog**              | Connect warehouses, S3-compatible buckets (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Spaces, B2) or an **Iceberg REST catalog** through a wizard; the crawler lists every table and object, groups partitioned folders into datasets, infers CSV/JSON schemas by sampling, profiles columns (null %, distinct counts, ranges), estimates row counts, and flags likely-PII columns. Schedule daily/weekly incremental crawls with schema-drift notifications, generate asset + column documentation with AI, certify or deprecate assets with owners and tags, trace lineage and usage (which dashboards, prep flows and metrics consume each table), define a business glossary, and jump straight into the SQL workbench.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 📊 **Business Intelligence**     | A dedicated **AI Analyst** (Spotter-style): reasoning-model analysts scoped to your data that plan → query → self-check → refine → write up, with a fully transparent step trace and one-click PDF export. Plus a BI Workspace with drag-and-drop dashboards: build charts from local datasets or connected data sources, generate visuals (or whole dashboards) with the AI analyst, then publish with a public link or share with IAM groups. Enterprise depth included: click-to-cross-filter and drill-down on every chart type (incl. maps, treemaps, heatmaps), drill-through that pushes the widget's filters, your drill level and the cross-filter into the query so the row count is real and the cap is disclosed, locale/currency number formatting, dashboard filters with date presets and pinned defaults, expandable matrix (pivot) with subtotals, version history with restore, scheduled refreshes with email reports and "what changed" insight digests, **incremental refresh** (re-query only a trailing date window), **SQL aggregation pushdown** so totals stay complete past the snapshot cap, data alerts (in-app + email), row-level security **and column-level masking** on shared dashboards (both enforced server-side), usage analytics, and a mobile-stacked layout. Organize dashboards into **workspaces & folders** with read-only group sharing, **promote** a personal draft into a shared workspace, and **export** model/dashboard definitions to a **Git** repo (GitHub/GitLab). |
| 🔍 **Observability**             | Inspect every tool call, token, and cost in a full execution trace — plus an audit trail of who did what (model calls, dataset & warehouse queries, dashboard views, catalog crawls) with a configurable retention window, and admin-only spend analytics broken down by user and IAM group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 🌐 **Web search & browsing**     | Give agents the `web_search` and `web_browse` tools. Both work with **no key**: page reads use a **built-in fetcher** that strips page chrome and converts to markdown (server-rendered pages only — it does not run JavaScript, and says so when a page comes back empty), and search falls back to DuckDuckGo's Instant Answer API, which returns entity summaries rather than ranked results. For real web search and JavaScript-rendered pages, connect **Firecrawl** on the Integrations page (or set `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`), or bring your own **Brave / SerpAPI / Tavily / ScrapingBee** key per agent. Every model-driven fetch is SSRF-guarded.

| 🛠️ **MCP Builder**               | Write an MCP server in Python with **FastMCP** under **Build → MCP Builder**, deploy it to the same sandboxed kernel the Developer workspace uses, and get a real Streamable-HTTP endpoint. It scales to zero by default (or stays warm), registers itself so your own agents can call it, and can be **exposed publicly** with hashed API keys that support expiry, per-tool and per-IP limits. Secrets bind as environment variables without ever entering the container environment, and a redeploy that changes any tool name, description or schema **blocks calls until you re-approve** — the anti "rug pull" control MCP's own security guidance asks for.

| 🌍 **Web Embedding + React SDK** | Put chat agents, swarm tasks, BI dashboards and the AI Analyst on any website. Two integration paths, one key: a copy-paste **iframe** snippet, or the **React SDK** (`@agentswarms/react`, in [`sdk/react`](./sdk/react/README.md)) with headless hooks (`useAgentChat`, `useAgentAnalyst`) and a themeable drop-in `<AgentChat />` for full UI control. Either way, every control is enforced **server-side**: domain allow-list, key expiry, per-key monthly budget cap, rate limits, guardrails and IAM model rules — disable the key and every integration stops instantly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 📓 **Developer workspace**       | Python notebooks on **sandboxed server kernels** — real CPython with working `pip install` and genuine **LangChain**, **LangGraph** and **LlamaIndex** imports, not a browser emulation. Ships with read-only, runnable samples for each plus a mixed agentic-stack capstone (knowledge base, tools, skills, guardrails, MCP) — fork any of them to edit. The built-in `agentswarms` helper calls your connected models, searches your knowledge base and **runs your saved agents and swarms**, all governed by IAM rules and logged in Traces — no provider key ever exists inside the sandbox. A notebook can also be **published as a callable API**, and versioned to Git as plain Python.

## Quickstart

**One-command setup** — after you've created a Supabase project and put its keys
in `.env` (see below), a script handles the rest (secrets, deps, migrations, and
bringing up the stack):

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill in your Supabase keys, then:
bash scripts/setup.sh --all           # EVERYTHING  →  http://localhost:8080
# bash scripts/setup.sh               # core stack only (the app; optional services off)
# bash scripts/setup.sh --dev         # local dev server instead
# Windows PowerShell:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup.ps1 -All
```

**No Supabase account at all?** One command deploys the entire solution —
**self-hosted Supabase (Docker) + the app** — with nothing to sign up for and
nothing to copy by hand. The script downloads and starts the official Supabase
Docker stack, generates every secret and key (Postgres password, JWT secret,
the API keys signed from it), applies the schema, creates your admin user, and
writes all of it into `.env` automatically before bringing up the app:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-selfhosted.sh --all      # Supabase + EVERYTHING  →  http://localhost:8080
# ADMIN_EMAIL=you@corp.com bash scripts/setup-selfhosted.sh --all   # non-interactive
# Windows: run it in WSL or Git Bash, with Docker Desktop running
```

Budget ~2 GB of image pulls and +2 vCPU / +4 GB RAM for the Supabase stack.
Details, production hardening and the manual equivalent:
**[INSTALL.md § self-hosted](./docs/INSTALL.md#option-b--self-hosted-supabase-docker-no-account-needed)**
and **[DEPLOYMENT.md § Self-hosted Supabase](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#self-hosted-supabase-complete-data-residency)**.

Or do it by hand — there is no separate backend to install, since **Supabase
_is_ the backend** (Postgres + Auth + Storage), run as a free-tier hosted
project rather than installing anything yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgentSwarms-fyi/agentswarms.git
cd agentswarms
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your Supabase + provider keys
# apply the database schema once: npx supabase login && npx supabase link && npx supabase db push
npm run dev            # → http://localhost:8080
```

Self-host with Docker (any Node-capable host — VPS, Fly, Railway, Render, K8s):

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in Supabase + keys, apply migrations once
docker compose --profile docgen --profile notebooks --profile sandbox up --build
# → http://localhost:8080   (plain `docker compose up --build` starts the app alone)
```

`--all` / the profile list above brings up the optional services too: the
**document renderer** (native PowerPoint/Word/Excel), the **JS sandbox** (custom
code in deployed swarm runs) and the **Developer-workspace runtime** (real Python
kernels). They are separate profiles because each costs something — LibreOffice
is a large image, and the notebook runtime needs Docker-socket access through a
least-privilege proxy. Once up, **Observability → Monitoring** shows every
service's health in one place.

First time? Follow **[the full installation guide](./docs/INSTALL.md)** — it
covers every step on macOS, Linux, and Windows, including the Supabase
dashboard clicks and a troubleshooting section for the errors people
actually hit. Wondering what hardware you need (spoiler: a 2 vCPU / 4 GB VM,
no GPU)? See **[System requirements & sizing](./docs/SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS.md)**.

**"Does it handle billions of rows?"** Aggregate queries compile to SQL that
runs **inside your warehouse**, so table size is your warehouse's problem and
only the grouped result travels. Anything that materialises locally is capped —
local datasets at 500k rows, dashboard snapshots at 500 rows, warehouse result
sets at 1,000 (5,000 hard ceiling). Every number, and the environment variable
that changes it, is in **[Scale and limits](./docs/SCALE_AND_LIMITS.md)**.

| **[Testing](./docs/TESTING.md)**                                         | Running the suite, the differential SQL-engine harness, and what CI does and does not gate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **[Database schema health check](./docs/SCHEMA_HEALTH_CHECK.md)**        | The pop-up that catches an unapplied migration — a contributor pulled code that expects a column/table their Supabase project doesn't have yet — and shows copyable `supabase db push` / `migration up` / `db reset` commands instead of a cryptic PostgREST error. How to register a new check when you add a migration.       |
| **[Agent Chat & document generation](./docs/AGENT_CHAT.md)**             | Chatting with a saved agent, per-agent **Visual BI** answers, and generating fully-editable **PowerPoint / Word / Excel** from your prompt (with Sample vs. full-data scope and live Excel formulas) — plus embedding an agent on your own site.                                                                                |
| **[Data sources & connectors](./docs/DATA_SOURCES.md)**                  | Every database / warehouse / lakehouse connector (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Synapse, Trino, Athena): fields, the read-only + encrypted-credential model, `{{secret:NAME}}` references, and how sources feed the catalog, BI and agents.                                             |
| **[Business Intelligence](./docs/BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.md)**             | Dashboards and the AI analyst: 19 visual types incl. the AI-built ontology, drill-down & forecasting, scheduled refresh + data alerts, AI-generated dashboards, workspaces & folders, dev→prod promotion, Git export, publishing / embedding / export, data prep, and connectors.                                               |
| **[Semantic Layer](./docs/SEMANTIC_LAYER.md)**                           | Governed metrics + dimensions defined once and consumed by both BI and AI agents (the `metric_query` tool), so business definitions compute consistently and the AI picks names instead of writing SQL. Models can declare LEFT/INNER joins, so metrics span a star schema without pre-joining.                                 |
| **[Knowledge bases](./docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASES.md)**                         | Sources incl. **Google Drive, Notion, SharePoint and Dropbox** connectors, scheduled sync with two-level dedup (unchanged files aren't re-downloaded, unchanged content isn't re-embedded), per-source access scopes incl. provider-ACL mirroring, and the credential/security model.                                           |
| **[Access control (IAM) & SSO](./docs/IAM.md)**                          | Superadmins, groups, user provisioning, model allow-lists incl. the **deny-by-default** instance policy, read-only resource sharing, invite-only mode, and SAML SSO.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **[Developer workspace runtime](./docs/DEVELOPER_WORKSPACE_RUNTIME.md)** | Standing up the sandboxed Python kernels behind notebooks: the Docker/Kubernetes/E2B backends, the threat model and hardening, the egress allow-list, and how model and knowledge-base calls are brokered so no key reaches the sandbox.                                                                                        |
| **[Extending agents](./docs/EXTENDING.md)**                              | Adding **skills** (markdown `skill.md` capabilities, no code) and **built-in tools** (definition + handler + gate in the registry), plus how tool-routing guidance keeps source selection sane.                                                                                                                                 |
| **[Architecture](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**                               | Tech stack and project structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
