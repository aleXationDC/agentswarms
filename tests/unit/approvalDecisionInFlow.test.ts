// A human's approval decision has to be readable by the nodes after it.
//
// Approve-and-resume works: driven through the UI, a run parked at the gate,
// the inbox showed the amount, the cash-flow impact and the risk, Approve
// resumed it from that step without re-running the agent above, and the run
// completed. That whole mechanism is sound.
//
// What the run then said was wrong. The next node is a condition labelled
// "Approved?" asking "Did the approver let this proceed?" — and after a
// hand-approved run it answered NO, which became the swarm's FINAL OUTPUT.
//
// It could not have answered anything else. On approval the executor did
// `write(pending)` — the payload passes through unchanged — and nothing
// recorded the decision. So the condition was asked whether a human approved
// while being shown only a refund summary, which says nothing about it. It
// guessed.
//
// Rejection throws, so reaching a later node already implies approval. The fix
// makes that implication readable, and carries the approver's note, which is
// the part a branch might genuinely want to read ("approved, but cap it at
// $100").
//
// Asserted against the SOURCE because executing a swarm needs a live database,
// a checkpoint and a paid model call; the behaviour itself was verified by
// hand in the browser and is described above.
