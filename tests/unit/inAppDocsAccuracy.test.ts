// The in-app documentation has to describe the running software.
//
// These pages are what an operator configures from, so a stale claim here is
// not a typo — it is someone sizing a rate limit wrongly, or believing a cap
// holds when it does not. Two real examples, both found by this check:
//
//   - "Rate and concurrency limits are per process… N instances means N times
//     the limit" appeared on both the self-hosting and API pages. It stopped
//     being true when those limits moved to a Postgres-backed counter, and an
//     operator reading it would over-provision or, worse, assume the ceiling
//     was softer than it is.
//   - TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS and BUDGET_FAIL_CLOSED shipped in .env.example and
//     reached no in-app page at all — settings nobody would know to set.
//
// Note the deliberate asymmetry: WAREHOUSE_* concurrency IS still per process
// (governor.server holds an in-memory Map), so the docs saying so are correct
// and must not be "fixed".
