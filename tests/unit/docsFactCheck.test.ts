// it accumulates:
//
//   - ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS credited Pyodide for "in-browser Python notebooks",
//     which had been removed (notebooks.tsx says so in its own header), and
//     listed sharp/libvips (LGPL-3.0) in the LICENCE AUDIT SUMMARY when sharp
//     is not a dependency at all — the part of the document a legal reviewer
//     reads, naming a copyleft library that is not present.
//   - ARCHITECTURE listed notebooks as "In-browser Python via Pyodide
//     (+ optional server runtime)", exactly inverting what is true.
//   - a 501 message I wrote earlier in this work told operators to "run the
//     notebook with the browser (Pyodide) runtime" — advice pointing at a
//     deleted feature.
