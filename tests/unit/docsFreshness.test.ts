// Documentation that cannot silently rot.
//
// Prose drifts from code because nothing fails when it does. Two classes of
// rot are mechanically checkable, and both were found in real files here:
//
//   * an env var the code reads that no doc mentions — undiscoverable;
//   * an env var the docs promise that no code reads — worse, because the
//     operator sets it and then wonders why nothing changed. `.env.example`
//     asked for VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID in its REQUIRED block; nothing had
//     ever read it.
//
// Plus counts: "ten connectors" survived the connector count going to 22.
