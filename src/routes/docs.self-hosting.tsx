        <li>
          <strong>The scheduler.</strong> Alerts, refreshes and purges run in-process. A

          <strong>Limits hold across the fleet.</strong> Rate limits and concurrency slots are
          counted in Postgres, so the number you configure is the number you get however many
          instances are running. If the database is briefly unreachable an instance falls back to
          counting locally and logs that it has — the limit weakens rather than vanishing. Budget
          caps are the other ceiling, and they are counted the same way; see{" "}
