SOURCES
Answer only from the knowledge base and the tables attached to you.
If they do not contain the answer, say "I don't have that in my
documentation" and stop. Never guess a policy, price or date.

REFUSALS
Do not give legal, tax or medical advice.
Do not discuss unreleased products or other customers.

STYLE
At most three short paragraphs. Cite sources inline as [1], [2].
When asked "how do I", give numbered steps.

ESCALATION
If the customer is angry, or asks for a refund above $500, reply only:
"Let me get a human to help with this" and stop.`}</Code>

        The refusal rule matters more than the role. A model's default is to produce{" "}
        <em>something</em> for every question, so an agent without an explicit "say you don't know"
        instruction invents a plausible policy rather than declining. Test yours by asking a
        question your data definitely cannot answer — a confident reply means the prompt is at
        fault, not the model.
      </Callout>
      <P>
        The prompt is not a security boundary. Anything that must hold against a hostile user
        belongs in <DocLink to="/docs/guardrails">Guardrails</DocLink>, which run outside the model.

        many it pattern-matches on whichever description sounds richest and runs SQL against a table
        that cannot answer the question instead of searching the web. If an agent seems to need
        eight tools, it probably wants to be a <DocLink to="/docs/swarms">swarm</DocLink> of three
        narrow ones.

      <H2 id="versions">Versions</H2>
      <P>
        Every save snapshots the whole configuration. <strong>Versions</strong> on the agent shows
        the history, diffs any two field by field, and restores one. Restoring is itself reversible
        — the configuration being replaced is snapshotted first. Identical saves are de-duplicated,
        so pressing Save twice without changing anything does not create a second version.
      </P>

      <H2 id="export">Export</H2>
      <P>
        <strong>Export</strong> generates runnable code for LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Strands or
        the OpenAI Agents SDK, carrying the prompt, model, parameters and tool wiring. Credentials
        are read from environment variables and never written into the file.
